The method `handleRequest` is being called. The relevant arguments for handleRequest are `URI url`.
The values of the relevant fields of the class are `num`, `disnum`, and `messages`. 
The value `num` is incremented to 1 when the handlerequest is called.
The value`disNum` converts the  value `num` #1 into a string.
The value `messages` concatenate `num`, `disNum`, and the input of `parameters[1]` (which is the messages)
which will output `1. Hello` and creates a new line for the next input.

The method `handleRequest` is being called. The relevant arguments for handleRequest are `URI url`.
The values of the relevant fields of the class are `num`, `disnum`, and `messages`. 
The value `num` is incremented to 2 when the handlerequest is called again.
The value`disNum` converts the  value `num` #2 into a string.
The value `messages` concatenates `num`, `disNum`, and the input of `parameters[1]` (which is the messages)
which will output `2. World` with the old output `1. Hello`.
